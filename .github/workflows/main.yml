Running steps or jobs conditionally

GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context.

For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:

steps:
- run: npm publish
  if: github.event_name == 'push'

For more information, see "Contexts and expression syntax for GitHub Actions."
